## Motivation
My course started on 2011 with the goal to help Pecem with their optmization problems. As I'm in this course since the beginning, I feel responsible to make it happen.
As I was searching for a Combinatorial Optmization Problem to solve, I crossed by this variant of Bin Packing and then my eyes shone bright!! So I decided to go on with this project.
