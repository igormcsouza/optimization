## Tools for solving OR problems

### Pyomo
 - Pyomo has a [Documentation](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/pyomo/latest/pyomo.pdf) so we can have help on how to write scripts.
 - If you are using GLPK as solver, you must install GLPK or GLPSOL before run the command. To do so you just type the command bellow, and everything should be fine
 ```
 sudo apt-get install glpk-utils
 ```

### ORTools from Google
