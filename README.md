# Operational Research
Package full of algorithms to do optimizations, some of them solves problems from Linear Programming, Integer Programming and Non-Linear Programming.

## Tools for solving OR problems

### Pyomo
 - Pyomo has a [Documentation](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/pyomo/latest/pyomo.pdf) so we can have help on how to write scripts.
 - If you are using GLPK as solver, you must install GLPK or GLPSOL before run the command. To do so you just type the command bellow, and everything should be fine
 ```
 sudo apt-get install glpk-utils
 ```


### ORTools from Google

## Experiments

### MCPP - Multiple Container Packing Problem
 - It called my attention for been a variant of the bin packing problem and knapsacking problem.
